#+title: Nix Development Flakes
#+author: Chris Chambers
#+language: en-gb

Creates isolated, local, reproducible development environments using nix.

To bootstrap a Project:
#+begin_src sh :noeval
  # from within a project:
  nix flake init -t github:chrischambers/nix#${language}
  # from outside a project:
  nix flake new -t github:chrischambers/nix#${language} ${new_project_directory}
#+end_src

For example, to start your grand plan project in Clojure:
#+begin_src sh :noeval
  nix flake new -t github:chrischambers/nix#clojure ~/src/grand_plan
#+end_src

After selecting a project template, you can activate the shell two ways:

- Preferred: If you have [[https://direnv.net/][direnv]] and [[https://github.com/nix-community/nix-direnv][nix-direnv]] installed, run ~direnv allow~ once
  from within the directory. Any time you =cd= into the directory in future you'll
  have access to the shell.
- Otherwise, run =nix develop= from within the directory each time you want to use
  it.
